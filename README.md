# Daily Programmer Spider
The purpose of this project is to create a spider that goes through [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/), collecting the minimal information in each crawl to fill DynamoDB tables with this information. This spider will become a Lambda application that will be the backbone for my Daily Programmer leaderboard project.

## Running

It's not yet a Lambda project, so all you need to do is go into your terminal and type `gradle run`!
